## Introduction

Unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring that individual components of your application work correctly in isolation. Spring Boot, with its robust testing framework, makes it easy to write unit tests for your code. This repository provides a simple example of how to set up unit tests for a Spring Boot application using JUnit 5 and Mockito.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the unit tests in this project, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Java JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (version 8 or higher)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Haris-Ahmed07/SpringBoot_Unit-Testing_JUnit5_Mockito.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd SpringBoot_Unit-Testing_JUnit5_Mockito
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Running Tests

This project uses JUnit 5 and Mockito for unit testing. To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
mvn test
```

The test results will be displayed in your console, showing which tests passed and which failed.
